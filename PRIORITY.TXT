PRIORITY.EXE is public domain (C source and OS/2 16-bit (1.x)
executable).  It can be used to fire up an OS/2 application at any
priority.  Note that some OS/2 applications adjust their own priority;
this shouldn't be used with them.

To use, call as:

  PRIORITY.EXE <priclass> <pridelta> <prog to run> <args> <for> <prog>

<priclass> can be from 1 to 4.  Priority increases with the value of the
number, except that class 4 (which was added after class 3 already
existed) is lower than class 3.  So:    1  2  4  3  in order of
ascending priority.  PRIORITY will abort with errorlevel 1 if <priclass>
is invalid, or if not enough arguments are passed.  Otherwise, it
returns the errorcode returned by <prog to run>.

<pridelta> is from 0 to 31.  The higher the number the higher the
priority within the priority class.

<prog to run> is the program you want to run.

<args> <for> <prog> are the arguments passed to <prog to run>.  There
can be as many of them as you like.  Just thing of everything from <prog
to run> on as a regular command line.

TESTPRI.CMD in the archive will demonstrate how Priority works and
verify that it works as advertised.
